PROBLEMS WITH CURRENT KYC

Disparity in Specifications for KYC.
Every bank has their own KYC process setup and customers need to do the KYC again and again for each bank.
Due to lack of KYC standards compiling reach request is time-consuming.
Adverse impact on Customer relationship.
It becomes irksome for the customers to provide the same information to different banking entities and industries.
Banks may even follow up with customers to get more details on KYC.

SOLUTION USING BLOCKCHAIN

Banks can utilize the feature set of Blockchain to reduce the difficulties faced by the traditional KYC process. A distributed ledger can be setup between all the banks, 
where one bank can upload the KYC of a customer and other banks can vote on legitimacy of the customer details. KYC for the customers can be immutably stored and accesses 
from the Blockchain.
